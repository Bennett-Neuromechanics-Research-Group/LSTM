# LSTM
This repository contains the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network published in the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering (available online). Files include the network (KJCF_LSTM.mat), a readme (KJCF_LSTM_readme.docx), and a sample MATLAB script with corresponding dataset (KJCF_Example Script.m & KJCF_Sample_Data.mat).
Please cite the corresponding publication any time this network is implemented or referenced:
